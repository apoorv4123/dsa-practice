Everyone should try doing these questions because :
You will get to learn how to submit questions on online judges.
It will boost your confidence in Recursion. After attempting these questions Recursion and Backtracking will be a cakewalk.
We have done similar questions in class. Try to relate these questions with the questions we have done in class and think on similar  ways.
While submitting on leetcode, you need to return List<String>.
       So you can make a list this way : List<String> list_name = new ArrayList<String>() ;
We shall keep a doubt class next week for all these extra questions of leetcode.
